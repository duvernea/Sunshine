#Sunshine (Wearable Watch Face)
## Project 6 ("Go Ubiquitous") of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree

Synchronizes weather information from OpenWeatherMap on Android Phones, Tablets, and Wearables.

###### Detail
Project 6 specifically focuses on creating the watch face for wearables so that users can access Sunshine's weather information at a glance.  The mobile app utilizes the GoogleAPIClient to send weather info via the data layer. The watch face service receives the data and draws watch face with time, date, and weather.
